            <h3>Summary</h3>

            There's no perfect moment to start journey. My path in IT has been a
            winding road, filled with growth and unexpected turns.<br><br>

            My journey began with a solid foundation in computer science,
            leading me to explore various aspects of software development.
            From my early days of coding to now working with cutting-edge
            technologies like React.js and IoT, it's been an exciting ride.<br><br>

            A pivotal moment in my career was joining Four Tuples Solution as
            a Backend Developer. There, I had the opportunity to oversee back-
            end development using PHP, ensuring website integrity, security,
            and efficiency. This experience allowed me to hone my skills in both
            server-side programming and database management, particularly
            with MySQL for effective data storage and retrieval. I gained
            valuable experience in planning website development, transforming
            mock-ups into functional web interfaces, and integrating them with
            databases. Additionally, I developed proficiency in REST APIs and
            agile methodologies, showcasing my skills in API development and
            comprehensive testing using Postman. This role not only enhanced
            my technical abilities but also provided me with valuable experience
            in team management and leadership, fostering a collaborative and
            innovative work environment.

            on creating efficient, user-friendly software solutions that make a real
            difference.<br><br>

            deployment and management.<br>
            ➡️ I'm exploring ways to contribute to the development of critical
            healthcare applications.<br><br>
